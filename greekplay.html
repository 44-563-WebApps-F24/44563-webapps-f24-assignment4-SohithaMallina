</h2>

<p><b>PHI.</b>Thou art not base, but seemest to have learnt
    Some baseness from base men. Now, as ’tis meet,
    Be better guided—leave me mine arms, and go.</p>
    <p><b>NEO.</b>What shall we do?</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Enter ODYSSEUS.</p>
    <p><b>ODYSSEUS.</b>What art thou doing, knave?
        Give me that bow, and haste thee back again.</p>
    <p><b>PHI.</b>Alas! What do I hear? Odysseus’ voice?</p>
    <p><b>OD.</b>Be sure of that, Odysseus, whom thou seest.</p>
     <p><b>PHI.</b>Oh, I am bought and sold, undone! ’Twas he
        That kidnapped me, and robbed me of my bow.</p>
        <p><b>OD.</b>Yea. I deny it not. Be sure, ’twas I.</p>
            <p><b>PHI.</b>Give back, my son, the bow; release it!</p>
                <p><b>OD.</b>That,
                    Though he desire it, he shall never do.
                    Thou too shalt march along, or these shall force thee.</p>
                    <p><b>PHI.</b>They force me! O thou boldest of bad men!
                        They force me?</p>
                        <p><b>OD.</b>If thou com’st not willingly.</p>
